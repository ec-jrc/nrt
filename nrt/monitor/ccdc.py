    """Monitoring using CCDC-like implementation

    Implementation loosely following method described in Zhu & Woodcock 2014.

    Zhu, Zhe, and Curtis E. Woodcock. 2014. “Continuous Change Detection and

    Attributes:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should
            be monitored (1) and not (0). The mask may be updated following
            history period stability check, and after a call to monitor
            following a confirmed break. Values are as follow.
            ``{0: 'Not monitored', 1: 'monitored', 2: 'Unstable history',
            3: 'Confirmed break - no longer monitored'}``
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        beta (np.ndarray): 3D array containing the model coefficients
        x (numpy.ndarray): array of x coordinates
        y (numpy.ndarray): array of y coordinates
        sensitivity (float): sensitivity of the monitoring. Lower numbers are
            high sensitivity. Value can't be zero.
        boundary (int): Number of consecutive observations identified as outliers
            to signal as disturbance
        rmse (np.ndarray): 2D float array indicating RMSE for each pixel
        detection_date (numpy.ndarray): 2D array signalling detection date of
            disturbances in days since 1970-01-01

    Args:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should be
            monitored marked as ``1`` and pixels that should be excluded (marked
            as ``0``). Typically a stable forest mask when doing forest disturbance
            monitoring. If no mask is supplied all pixels are considered and
            a mask is created following the ``fit()`` call
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        sensitivity (float): sensitivity of the monitoring. Lower numbers are
            high sensitivity. Value can't be zero.
        boundary (int): Number of consecutive observations identified as outliers
            to signal as disturbance

            ``.from_netcdf()``

        If screen outliers is required, green and swir bands must be passed.

        The stability check will use the same sensitivity as is later used for
        detecting changes (default: 3*RMSE)

        Args:
            dataarray (xr.DataArray): xarray Dataarray including the historic
                data to be fitted
            method (string): Regression to use. See ``_fit()`` for info.
            screen_outliers (string): Outlier screening to use.
                See ``_fit()`` for info.
            green (xr.DataArray): Green reflectance values to be used by
                ``screen_outliers``.
            swir (xr.DataArray): Short wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance values
                to be used by ``screen_outliers``.
            scaling_factor (int): Optional Scaling factor to be applied to
                ``green`` and ``swir``. When ``screen_outliers`` is ``'CCDC_RIRLS'``
                (default for CCDC), the outlier screening algorithm expects green
                and swir reflectance values in the [0,1] range. EO data are often
                scaled and stored as integer, with a scaling factor to convert
                between scaled and actual reflectance values. As an example, if
                scaled reflectance values are in the [0,10000] range, set
                ``scaling_factor`` to ``10000``.
