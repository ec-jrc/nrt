Changes
=======

0.2.0
-----

- np.linalg.inv replaced by the more recommanded np.linalg.solve in many places
- Integration of numba parallel accelerator in most fitting functions (new argument
  to control number of threads in the .fit method of BaseNrt class)
- Possibility to pass kwargs to function of data module that load xarray.Datasets
  objects (particularly useful to specify chunking and get a dask based object)
- New example in gallery on parallel fitting
- Add a minimum python version requirement (>=3.9). 3.8 not longer tested


0.1.1
-----

- New set of functions to generate synthetic data (single time-series and DataArrays)
  added to the data module
- Gallery section added to the documentation, with one example on use of synthetic data
  for nrt simulation and computation of performance metrics 

0.1.0 (2022-04-27)
------------------

- The report() method can now receive a list of layers as argument to select the
  attributes of the monitoring instance to be retrieved and written to disk. Backward
  compatibility of the .report() method is not affected but backward compatibility
  of the private ._report() method, used to prepare the array is broken

0.0.5 (2022-03-21)
